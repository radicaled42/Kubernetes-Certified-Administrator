# Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS)  

_Before to start_

Ensure you have the right version of Kubernetes documentation selected (e.g. v1.16 as of 20th Nov. 2019 exam) especially for API objects and annotations. This release removes several deprecated API's.

## Exam Objectives

These are the exam objectives you review and understand in order to pass the test.

 (etcd, kubelet, kubedns, kubeapi)
1. [Properly set up Ingress objects with security control]()
1. [Protect node metadata and endpoints]()
1. [Minimize use of, and access to, GUI elements]()
1. [Verify platform binaries before deploying]()

### 15% - Cluster Hardening
1. [Restrict access to Kubernetes API]()
1. [Use Role Based Access Controls to minimize exposure]()
    * [handy site collects together articles, tools and the official documentation all in one place](https://rbac.dev/)
1. [Exercise caution in using service accounts e.g. disable defaults, minimize permissions on newly created ones]()
1. [Update Kubernetes frequently]()
1. [Minimize host OS footprint (reduce attack surface)]()

### 20% - Minimize Microservice Vulnerabilities

1. [Setup appropriate OS level security domains e.g. using PSP, OPA, security contexts]()
1. [Manage kubernetes secrets]()
1. [Use container runtime sandboxes in multi-tenant environments (e.g. gvisor, kata containers)]()
1. [Implement pod to pod encryption by use of mTLS]()

### 20% - Supply Chain Security
1. [Minimize base image footprint]()
1. [Secure your supply chain: whitelist allowed image registries, sign and validate images]()

1. [Scan images for known vulnerabilities]()


### 20% - Monitoring, Logging and Runtime Security

1. [Perform behavioral analytics of syscall process and file activities at the host and container
 level to detect malicious activities]()
1. [Detect threats within physical infrastructure, apps, networks, data, users and workloads]()
1. [Detect all phases of attack regardless where it occurs and how it spreads]()
1. [Perform deep analytical investigation and identification of bad actors within environment]()
1. [Ensure immutability of containers at runtime]()
1. [Use Audit Logs to monitor access]()
