# Information for each of the Kubernetes certifications

Online resources that will help you prepare for taking the Kubernetes certifications exam.

**Disclaimer**: This is not likely a comprehensive list as the exam will be a moving target with the fast pace of k8s development - please make a pull request if there something wrong or that should be added, or updated in here.

I tried to restrict the cross references of resources to [kubernetes.io](kubernetes.io). Youtube videos and other blog resources are optional; however, I still found them useful in my k8s learning journey.

Ensure you have the right version of Kubernetes documentation selected (e.g. v1.18 as of 23rd April 2020 exam) especially for API objects and annotations.
